# Java-NumberWriter
This allows you to write any number in letters. Only works in Java.
There is a limit to the input, wich is 999 999 999, for this version of the repository. I will be updating the repository to make bigger numbers.
If you use this in a public project, please credit me in the README of CREDIT file. Thanks :)
