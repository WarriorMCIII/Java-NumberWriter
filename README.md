# Java-NumberWriter
This allows you to write any number in letters. Only works in Java.
You can use this to write any number from -999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 to 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 (pretty big numbers).
If you need a number bigger than the these numbers, follow the steps in the NumberWriter class.
If you use this in a public project, please credit me in the README of CREDIT file. Thanks :)
