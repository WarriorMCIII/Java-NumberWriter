# Java-NumberWriter
This class takes a number as a String input and writes the number down in words.
The number can go from 
-999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 
to 
999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 (pretty big numbers), but you can write bigger numbers if needed.
To write bigger numbers, follow the step in the NumberWriter class.
If you use this in a public project, please credit me in the README of CREDIT file. Thanks :)
